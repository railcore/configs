## Duet Configurations for RailCore Printers

**WARNING: The RailCore is a DIY project. Build safe, build smart and BE RESPONSIBLE.**
**When in doubt, double check things. USE COMMON SENSE AND USE THESE CONFIG FILES AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

The "duet" folder contains a Duet configuration bundle for RepRapFirmware Duet (Ethernet/Wifi) for the RailCore II 300ZL and 300ZLT.

A main "config.g" file that provides the most basic, common settings for your RailCore kit build, is provided. Some useful macros are also provided.

The configs are initially maintained by Kraegar on Dropbox and can be found at:-
