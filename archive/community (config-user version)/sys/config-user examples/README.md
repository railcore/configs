## Config-user examples

WARNING: The RailCore is a DIY project. Build safe, build smart and BE RESPONSIBLE.
When in doubt, double check things. USE COMMON SENSE AND USE THESE CONFIG FILES AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This folder contains example files to enable your RailCore fully in various configurations.

Either create your own or take an existing file to base your config on,and name it "config-user.g".
Place this file in /sys replacing the existing one.

There are two special example files, one for the kit and one for self-builders. 
Each config file enabled to allow the RailCore to be operational in this mode, and many conservative values
will be inherited from the stock config.g
To override these and unleash your railcores speeds, size or features, then you must test, measure and uncomment the various lines, preferably individually.

Read the Duet G-code documentation on any line you are unsure with.
