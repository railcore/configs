1) Backup your entire /sys
	If you use M500 & config-override.g I recommend removing the M500 from config.g for now, and copying your values into config.g before starting
	Delete config-override.g once you've moved its values into config.g
	You may want to move your hotend fan into an always on port if you've moved it, at least temporarily.
2) download the zip file Duet2and3Firmware-3.0.zip from here: https://github.com/dc42/RepRapFirmware/releases/tag/3.0 (DO NOT INSTALL IT YET)
3) If you're not running Duet Web Control 2.04, download it from the same link (DuetWebControl-SD-2.04.zip). Install it now.
4) edit homex.g homey.g homez.g homeall.g deployprobe.g retractprobe.g bed.g (or just replace them, either way)
	Edits to home files are to change S1 to H1, S2 to H2
	Edits to deploy/retract are to change P3 to P0
	Edits to bed.g: remove unnecessary S2
5) edit config.g (search the config.g for _RRF3_ and follow the notes)  DO NOT REBOOT WHEN DONE EDITING
	Edits for config.g:
		Change thermistor lines from M305 to M308 (comment out the M305 lines, move your thermistor T/B/C values if you've customized them) into M308 format)
		Add two M950 lines to define the bed & extruder0 heaters
		Add three M950 lines to define hotend and layer fans.
		Comment out M574 endstop definition, add two new M574 lines
		Comment out M307 and M558 for bltouch, add in new M950 & M558.  (adjust F,T,A,S values if you've customized them)
		IF YOU USE A PIEZO, IR PROBE, OR OTHER ZPROBE YOU NEED TO MODIFY YOUR M558 ACCORDINGLY
6) upload duet2and3firmeware-3.0.zip and reboot when it prompts
7) Check hotend / bed show correct values FIRST.  If not, stop immediately so we can fix that. (I highly recommend you have your hotend fan always on for these tests)
8) Check your x/y endstop status using M119 (both with endstop triggered and open)
9) Check your zprobe status.  Test deploying and retracting (copy the gcode into your consle)
10) Test home x / y
11) Test home Z
12) Test bed heat
13) Test hotend heat
