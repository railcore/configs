;File     : config-user.g for the Project R3D Kit
;Effect   : Provides a custom configuration area for the Railcore user.
;Use-case : By keeping any custom definitions in this file (such as Z probe attributes, axis minima/maxima and anything else that you wish to override in config.g
;         : it will enable the user to easily keep track of their own changes to the default config, as well as provide a simple upgrade path for future Github releases.

; Z probe and compensation definition
; *** WARNING - **Always** make sure your cables are correct, secure and test them thoroughly before homing Z for the first times!
; INSTRUCTIONS :   1) Uncomment your configuration lines
;                  2) M558 *** Do not add the Fxxx parameter for M558 here, it is set in homez.g
;                  3) G31 configuration
;                   a) Customize your offsets appropriately, where the probe is X Y is offset from the nozzle.
;                   b) Z is the trigger height (how high your nozzle is from the bed when the probe triggers). You need to dial those in.
; c) Tip: A larger trigger height in G31 moves you CLOSER to the bed

; ** REMEMBER to place deployprobe.g and retractprobe.g from the bltouch directory into the /sys directory and read the README CAREFULLY.
