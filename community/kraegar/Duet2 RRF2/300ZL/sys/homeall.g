; This file assumes the endstop switches are at the low end of each axis.
; Reverse the X and Y movement for high-end switches.
; Adjust the bed upper and lower limits in config.g (M208 commands) to get the correct homing positions

; If you are using a microswitch for Z homing, insert similar code for the Z axis here,
; but use lower feed rates suitable for your Z axis.

; If you homed the Z axis using an endstop switch, you can insert a G92 command here to correct the height.

; The following code assumes you are using a Z probe to do Z homing. Remove it if you are using a microswitch.
; Adjust the XY coordinates in the following to place the Z probe over a suitable spot,
; preferably near the centre of the bed if your Z probe supports that
